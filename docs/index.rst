Overview
--------

Databench provides the executables ``scaffold-databench`` and ``databench``, Python modules for the backend and a JavaScript library for the frontend. ``scaffold-databench helloworld`` creates an analysis template called *helloworld* in the current working directory. Running ``databench`` creates a local web server which you can access at http://localhost:5000. A good way to start is to jump right into :ref:`quickstart`.
